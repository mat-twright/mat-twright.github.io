It is said that the most recent common ancestor of every European today lived around 1400. In other words, every European has a great, great, ... grandparent in common, and that man or woman was alive in the year 1400. To phrase it differently again, I am (and so are you) a direct descendant of Charlemagne, of William the Conqueror, of Constantine and Caesar. The mind-boggles, but let's focus here on what really matters: what impact will this have on the Bunny Cup? Let me paint a picture:

To start, we'll say every Bunny Cup participant from the ages of 6 to 80 (sorry Grandad). Then that everyone has a child at 30, and a 60% chance of another at 32. This simple model let's us see how the Cup will grow.

| **2022** | **10** |
| -------- | ------ |
| **2023** | 10     |
| **2024** | 9      |
| **2025** | 9      |
| **2026** | 9      |
| **2027** | 9      |
| **2028** | 9      |
| **2029** | 9      |
| **2030** | 9      |
| **2031** | 9      |
| **2032** | 9      |
| **2033** | 9      |
| **2034** | 9      |
| **2035** | 9      |
| **2036** | 9      |
| **2037** | 10     |
| **2038** | 11     |
| **2039** | 13     |
| **2040** | 14     |

Yet such a method is slow and laborious. A family grows like a virus spreads: exponentially (i.e., growing by mulitiplying by X, rather than adding X). Accordingly, our model above can be exponentially modelled itself: number of participants = e^-27.51 * e^(0.0149*year)

The number of participants will double every 50 years, quadrupling every century, and getting about a million times larger every millenium.

**The Dodgy Bit**

Here's the problem: we've assumed that descendants of the founders won't have children with other descendants. I really wish we could say that. If it were true, Charlemagne – who lived 1200 years ago (or 40 generations) – would have over a trillion living descendants. He does not [citation needed].

To conclude: (1) the most recent common ancestor of every European today lived around 1400; (2) this is only because of incest; (3) a simple model shows the Bunny Cup to grow like e^-27.51 * e^(0.0149*year); (4) this factors out incest; (5) let's all hope to God the model is right.
